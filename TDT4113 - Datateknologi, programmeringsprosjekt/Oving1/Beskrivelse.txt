In short, the main job of your Arduino code is to continuously sample the button state, register
when it changes (from HIGH to LOW or LOW to HIGH), and then, when such a change is detected, 
use the time between the current change and the last change to determine the duration of
the intervening press or pause. That duration will then permit identification of one of the 5 signal
classes; and whenever the signal is anything other than a short pause, that signal should be sent
to the Python program running on your laptop. 1
