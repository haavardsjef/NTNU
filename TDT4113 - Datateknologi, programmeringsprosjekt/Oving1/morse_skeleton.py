'''This file provides a few of the 'tricky' elements of the Morse Code project: those
involving setting up and reading from the serial port.  

IMPORTANT!! If you are a MAC user, you will need to modify the actual device code for 
your serial port in arduino_connect.py '''

# convenient at the Arduino level. However, I've switched to 0 and 1 in this dictionary, since it is a lot easier to
# read.  So O = dot, 1 = dash in the _morse_codes dictionary below.  You will need to remember that when looking
# up letters and digits in this dictionary.

    # of function 'int' on the string converts it automatically.   But, due to latencies, the signal sometimes
    # consists of 2 ascii codes, hence the little for loop to cycle through each byte of the signal.

''' To test if this is working, do the following in a Python command window:

> from morse_skeleton import *
> m = mocoder()
> m.decoding_loop()

If your Arduino is currently running and hooked up to the serial port, then this
simple decoding loop will print the raw signals that the Arduino sends to
the serial port.  Each time you press (or release) your morse-code device, a signal should
appear in your Python window. In Python, these signals typically look like this:
 b'5' or b'1' or b'3', etc.
