n = len(numb) # This does not need to be edited


# Deciding Z - value
# Edit this part depending on if n >= 30.
# By default it works for n < 30

# Include this part if n >= 30:
# Z = 1.960 # For 95% the Z value is 1,960
# print("Using normal distribution!")

# If you included the paragraph above, then this needs to be commented out.
# This is the Z value for a t-distribution instead of a normal distribution
# Use this only when n < 30
