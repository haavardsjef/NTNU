1. Define Artifical Intelligence
The term artifical intelligence was first used by John McCarthy, who stated that "It is the science and engineering
of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs". But AI has no true definition, and the term
is often used on systems that differ greatly in terms of complexity. The merriam webster dictionary defines AI to be "A branch
of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers." and "The capability of a machine to
imitate intelligent human behavior". Russel & Norvig mentions a few different definitions of AI, including "The study of how
to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better." (Rich and Knight, 1991). My personal favorite is
"(AI is) the study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act" (Winston, 1992).

2. What is the turing test, and how is it conducted?
The turing test is named after Alan Turing, and is a test to see if a computer can act intelligently. The test is conducted
by someone communication with a computer or a human using only a screen and a keyboard, and the test is considered a success if
the tester can't tell if they are communication with a computer or a human being.
