1. Why does inline style CSS override rules defined in style elements and external stylesheets?
Because inline styling has a higher priority than style elemens and external stylesheets.
This is to give us more precise control over our styling.

2. Give a brief example of when to use ID ( #id ) and when to use classes ( .class ) in CSS
ID should be used when the styling only needs to be applied to one singular tag, classes should
be used when we need to re-use the same styling for multiple tags.

3. What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?
RGBA means Red, Green, Blue, Alpha. You can express each color with a value from 0-255 and the
alpha value from 0-1. The alpha is the transparancy of the color. With typical RGB you can
express 16,777,216 colors, and using RGBA you can also differentiate by transparancy.

4. Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body element?
We include CSS files in the head so that they will load before the body, that way we can prevent the
user from seeing a ugly webpage with default styling before the stylesheets load. First impressions
are key.
