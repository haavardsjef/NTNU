        I have coded a lot previously, including a bit of webdevelopment.
        Technologies and languages I've used include HTML, CSS, Javascript.

        My expectations for this subject is to learn best practices for
        developing webpages.

        All in all I believe/hope that this course will be a very good learning
        resource.

          The server serves the content (ex. the webpage) when the client
          requests it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The client is typically controlled by the user, and requests content
          (ex. the webpage) from a server.
        </li>
        <li>
          An IP address is a unique identifier for every device connected to the
          internet, the IP address is attached to any package sent across the
          web, so that it ends up in the right place. It is very much comparable
          to a house address.
        </li>
        <li>
          DNS stands for Domain Name System, and is what maps the domain to the
          IP address of the server. This is really helpful for humans, as its a
          lot easier to remember "google.com" than a long IP address containing
          seemingly random numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          The internet is what we call the massive network of computers/devices
          across the globe. The WWW is a system for accessing the internet, but
          there also exists other such systems that access the internet .
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML is the standard markup language for browsers that access the
          world wide web. Webpages are described using HTML and sent to the
          clients web browser, which renders the page on the screen. It is
          important to have such a standarized markup language to ensure
          webpages being compatible with different browsers.
