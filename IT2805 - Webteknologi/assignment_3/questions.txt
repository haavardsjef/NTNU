1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed?
Position absolute positions relative to the first parent container if it has a position attribute (other than static).
If it has no such parent, it positions relative to the viewport.
The position fixed positions relative to the viewport/browser window.

2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
Using the :nth-child(3) pseudo selector. So for example if we want to style the 3rd child
of a div with class "container", we would do:
.container:nth-child(3){styling here}
