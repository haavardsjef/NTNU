1. To get a three dimensional drawing context we can can call the method getContext("webgl") on the canvas element.

2. To create a blue circle using the canvas element we can use the beginPath(), arc() and fill() method.
We also have to set the fillStyle to "blue".
The final code would be something like:
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(x, y, r, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
ctx.fill();
Where x and y are the coordinates for the center of the circle, and r is the radius.
The 0 and 2pi are the starting and ending angles of the arc, so these have to be exactly this way if we want a complete circle.

3. 
const countriesStartingWithN = countries.filter((country) => country[0] == "N");

alternatively we could write:

const countriesStartingWithN = countries.filter((country) => country.startsWith("N"));
